# discovery-heap
Personal scrappy project for testing, discovery and mistakes

## Collections of steps and some ideas
- Initialize tables for database
- Initialize necessary empty directories ( like `log` and `database`), or look into alternatives to commit empty directories
- Show session data on top navigation when user is logged in
- Unit tests ?
- Organize templates into sub-directories
